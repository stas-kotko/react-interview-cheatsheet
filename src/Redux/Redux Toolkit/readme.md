# What is Redux Toolkit?

Redux Toolkit is an official recommended approach for writing Redux logic. The `@reduxjs/toolkit` package wraps around the core `redux` package, and contains API methods and common dependencies that are essential for building a Redux app. Redux Toolkit builds in  best practices, simplifies most Redux tasks, prevents common mistakes, and makes it easier to write Redux applications.

RTK includes utilities that help simplify many common use cases, including store setup, creating reducers and writing immutable update logic, and even creating entire "slices" of state at once.
